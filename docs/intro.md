# A Better Developer Experience

> A TypeScript Starter Kit that will help you bootstrap your next project without minimal opinion.

# bun-ts-starter

This is an opinionated TypeScript Starter kit to help kick-start development of your next Bun package.

## Get Started

It's rather simple to get your package development started:

```bash
# you may use this GitHub template or the following command:
bunx degit stacksjs/ts-starter my-pkg
cd my-pkg

 # if you don't have pnpm installed, run `npm i -g pnpm`
bun i # install all deps
bun run build # builds the library for production-ready use

# after you have successfully committed, you may create a "release"
bun run release # automates git commits, versioning, and changelog generations
```

_Check out the package.json scripts for more commands._

# Introduction to STX

STX is a modern UI engine that combines the elegance of Laravel Blade with the power of Bun. It's designed to make building user interfaces both enjoyable and efficient, with first-class TypeScript support and powerful features out of the box.

## What is STX?

STX is a UI engine that allows you to:
- Write templates with a clean, familiar syntax
- Use TypeScript directly in your templates
- Create reusable components with props and slots
- Leverage streaming rendering for better performance
- Build type-safe applications with full IDE support

## Key Features

### üöÄ Performance First
Built on Bun, STX delivers exceptional performance:
- Lightning-fast template compilation
- Minimal runtime overhead
- Efficient component rendering
- Smart caching and build optimization

### üí™ Type Safety
First-class TypeScript support:
- Full type checking in templates
- Type-safe props and events
- IDE autocompletion
- Error detection at build time

### üß© Component System
Build reusable UI components:
- Props validation
- Slots and named slots
- Component lifecycle hooks
- Scoped styles

### üîÑ Directives
Powerful template directives:
```stx
@if(user.isAdmin)
  <admin-panel />
@else
  <user-panel />
@endif

@foreach(items as item)
  <list-item :data="item" />
@endforeach
```

### üé® Styling
Multiple ways to style your components:
```stx
<style>
  .button {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white px-4 py-2 rounded;
  }
</style>
```

### üõ† Developer Tools
Comprehensive tooling support:
- VSCode extension with syntax highlighting and IntelliSense
- DevTools for debugging and performance monitoring
- CLI for project scaffolding and build management

## Quick Example

Here's a simple STX component:

```stx
@ts
interface ButtonProps {
  type?: 'primary' | 'secondary'
  size?: 'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'
  disabled?: boolean
}
@endts

@component('Button', {
  props: {
    type: 'primary',
    size: 'md',
    disabled: false
  }
})
  <button 
    class="btn btn-{{ type }} btn-{{ size }}"
    :disabled="disabled"
  >
    <slot></slot>
  </button>

  <style>
    .btn {
      @apply rounded font-medium;
    }
    .btn-primary {
      @apply bg-blue-500 text-white;
    }
    .btn-secondary {
      @apply bg-gray-500 text-white;
    }
  </style>
@endcomponent
```
